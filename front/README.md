### Installation of the Vue.js application
It's early stages of UI development on the Groupomania app.  There are no dependencies to install yet.  The repository contains all the code needed to build and run the app front-end.
 
Start the app from the `./front/`  folder at the top level of the repository by running    
   
`cd front`  
`npm run start`    
    

The server should then listen on default port `8080` at the address `localhost`, [addressed in the browser](http:/localhost:8080/index.html) at

`http:/localhost:8080/index.html` .
